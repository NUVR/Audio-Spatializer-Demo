# Audio-Spatializer-Demo
Testing 3D sound landscapes in Unity. This simple demo scene (located in [Assets/Customizable_Furnture/BedroomScene](Assets/Customizable_Furnture/BedroomScene)) plays audio from a [TED Talk about VR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXHil1TPxvA) and empathy. Great, simple demo to showcase the power of 3D audio spatializers.

## Controls
Mouse controls are a bit quirky (since this was a quick demo thrown together in class) but the player can move using the WASD or arrow keys as needed.

## Audio

Audio is sourced at the alarm table clock. Clicking on that object reveals the 3D sound settings within the `default` GameObject.
